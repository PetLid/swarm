#SWARM
Simple Boid implementation in Unity.
Each individual in the swarm acts according to certain rules. 
The degree of adherence to each rule can be tweaked in the game.

#Usage
Open project with Unity and run it from there or use the SWARM.exe executable (built for Windows).

Start by placing the spawn point and hitting spacebar or the green start button. Using the GUIy you can place a goal (target icon) and an obstacle (fan icon), and change the settings by clicking the icon with a cog. I recommend turning up all the settings (except for swarm size) to get the most interesting behaviour.
